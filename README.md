# ML Project

This project was written by me during my machine learning course (CS 6350 at the
University of Utah) in the fall of 2017.

The original repository containing this code is private, as it also contains
solutions to other assignments from the class. I wanted to make this public, so
I had to create this new repository for it.

The data comes from the 2011 paper "Seven Months with the Devils: A Long-Term
Study of Content Polluters on Twitter" by Lee, Eoff, and Caverlee. It was
pre-processed for us by the course staff, but the data is too large to upload
(and I'm not sure if there are specific license issues with rehosting their data
anyway).

My project performed *okay*, though not fantastically. There were many
techniques which I could have tried to improve performance, and it's quite
possible (and perhaps even likely) that plenty of what I did implement was done
poorly or incorrectly. I think I spent too much time worrying about making a
well-engineered solution because it was kind of fun. Oh well!

This was my first foray into numpy/scipy/scikitlearn, so I think I probably did
not use those libraries to their fullest potential. If I were to do it all
again, I would spend more time getting comfortable with them and using them more
sufficiently.

To run the code, simply do `python3 project.py -h` and you'll get all the
relevant information on how to run the thing. Hopefully that's enough!
